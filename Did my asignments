#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
            - Software Engeneering is a discipline that aims in the systematic application of engineering Principle,methodes and tools such as IDEs, VCS and Testing frameworks for the develpment and maintainance of a high-quality software system.
            - The importances of software engineering to Technology industry include:
                    ~ Designing of a clear path way to structured approach to designing, developing, testing, and maintaining reliable, efficient, and secure software applications.
                    ~ Enabling the creation of software application and system that supports various areas such as education, communication ETC...

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.            
            - Development of programming language.
            - Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s.
            - The development of agile methodologies.
            

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
           - Requirement analysis ~ Gatthering and documenting the users needs and the system required.
           - Designing ~ Creating of a high quality and detailed design of the software architecture.
           - Implementation ~ Writing the code andbuilding the software arccording to the specification in the previous stage of identifying the software architecture.
           - Testing ~ Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
           - Deployment ~  Releasing of the software for use of to the customer.
           - Maintainance ~ Ongoing support, update and enhancement of the software by the developer.



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
            - Waterfall is a sequential approach with distinct stages i.e System development life cycle (SDLC) e. g Developing a Banking System while, The agile methodologies a an approach the deals wirh iterative process and incremental approach that is focused on flexibility, colaboaration and responding to changes e.g E-Commerce Website, Mobile App Development.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
            - Quality assuarance ~ checks the quality of software by designing and executing test;
                                        He/ She is responsible for ensuring software quality by identifying defects, preventing bugs, and improving product reliability, manual and automated testing, working closely with developers and product managers, Performance and Security Testing,  Collaboration, Bug Tracking and Reporting, Design and Execute Test Plans.
            - Project Manager ~ Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.
                                        He/ She is responsible for planning, executing, and delivering software projects within scope, budget, and timeline. They coordinate between teams, manage risks, and ensure stakeholders' requirements are met.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
            - An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) provides a comprehensive set of tools to assist developers in writing, testing, and debugging code. It includes a code editor, compiler, debugger, and automation tools in one interface. 
                    Example: Visual Studio Code, Elipse, IntelliJ IDEA.
            - A Version Control System (VCS) is a tool that tracks changes to code, allowing developers to collaborate, revert to previous versions, and merge changes safely, ideal for large projects that are team-based.
                    Example:  Subversion (SVN) and Git.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
            - Changing Requirements  leading to scope creep and project delays.
            - Tight Deadlines ~ Presure to deliver the software product on schedule resulting in rush development and compromised quality of the software.
            - Technical debt accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solitions leading to increased maintainance cost.

        Ways to ovecome this challenges;
            - Effective communication.
            - Employ Agile methodologies.
            - Prioritization of tasks.
            - Regular reassessment of project goals.
            - Timeliness to development process of the system/ software.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
            - Unit testing involves testing individual components or modules of software.
            - Intergration testing involves testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
            - System Testing involves testing the entire software system as a whole.
            - Acceptance Testing involves testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
            - Prompt engineering is the ability to craft questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.
        
        Importance of prompt engineering;
            - Helps to avoid getting confusing responses from the AI model by making it clear and specific.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
            - Example of an AI prompt: 
                    ~ "Tell me about cats."
                - Improved AI prompt;
                    ~ "Tell me about the history of domestic cats."
